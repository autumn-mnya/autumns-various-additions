__Autumns Various Additions v1.0.7__
-Fixed Life Drain.
-Added <EX+ -- Add experience to the player.
-Added <RVI -- Revives the player where they died. Revived HP is customizable in Settings.ini. This isn't the same as <RSP which reloads the map similar to a <LDP.
-Added <SBL -- Set a bullet on screen.
-Added <SCT -- Set a caret on screen.
-Change settings.ini readme for unencrypted TSC.
-Add new <PHY values to the dll. Previous save files with ava may break*.

*Technical note. All of the values are from the "boosteracceleration_and_maxspeed" xml hack. The values are in settings.ini now, so editing them in the hackinator wont do anything!!

-Added <RVI, <SBL, SCT, and <EX+ to the documentation.
