__Autumns Various Additions v1.2.0__
-Massive overhauls to the code
-Many features removed in favor of more cleanliness (Stage table support due to AutPI having it now, and collab mode due to it not being useful for many people, and being really complicated)

__Autumns Various Additions v1.1.1__
-AVA now requires "AutPI" (Autumns API) to be loaded before ava is loaded. It is included with the new zip file. Add it above autumns_various_additions in mods.txt!
-<BKG now supports Widescreen
-You can now buffer walljumps (toggleable via settings.ini, off by default)

-Jump Buffer will now get reset upon walljumping
-Jump Buffer bug fixes
-Double Jumps refreshing from walljumps will work all the time now

__Autumns Various Additions v1.0.7__
-Fixed Life Drain.
-Added <EX+ -- Add experience to the player.
-Added <RVI -- Revives the player where they died. Revived HP is customizable in Settings.ini. This isn't the same as <RSP which reloads the map similar to a <LDP.
-Added <SBL -- Set a bullet on screen.
-Added <SCT -- Set a caret on screen.
-Change settings.ini readme for unencrypted TSC.
-Add new <PHY values to the dll. Previous save files with ava may break*.

*Technical note. All of the values are from the "boosteracceleration_and_maxspeed" xml hack. The values are in settings.ini now, so editing them in the hackinator wont do anything!!

__Autumnal Lab v1.0.7__
-Added "TSCUNENCRYPTED" to the launch arguments. Adding this will make tsc unencrypted in editor.
-Added <RVI, <SBL, SCT, and <EX+ to the documentation.

-Added more <PHY values to the "CustomTSC.txt" documentation.
