A few FMod parameters are automatically set to "1.0" when doing certain things in the game.

Here's a list of them, so you can keep them in mind if you're using the FMod functionality of this dll.

isInWater --> Set when the player is in water.
isAirborne --> Set when the player is not touching the ground.
isAtHighXSpeed --> Set when the player is moving above 950 speed horizontally in either direction.
isAtHighYSpeed --> Set when the player is moving above 1300 speed vertically in either direction.
isAtHighSpeed --> Set when the player is moving at either of the speeds listed above.
isInWind --> Set when the player is in a wind tile, or using a fan.
