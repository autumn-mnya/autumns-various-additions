"<VAR", or the "Variable TSC hack", is a very advanced tsc hack. You can do some pretty cool stuff with it, but first you need to understand how it works!

Variables are basically just numbers that you have control over. You have variables 0000-0300 in total. Anything above that won't work!

For example, "Variable 0" is just a number, but using some of the commands listed in "CustomTSC.txt", you can do some pretty neat things!

Firstly, "<VA+wwww:xxxx" for example will add "X" to variable "W". Let's say the variable is "0", just for reference -- and we're adding "47" to it. Now Variable 0 is set to 47!

Now, you can also use this variable elsewhere outside of the variable commands as well! Any tsc command that uses a number should be able to read your variables, if you begin the number with a "V".

Example: <ML+V000 will add whatever "Variable 0" is, to the players max life. Since we set it to 47 in that example, <ML+V000 will add 47 max life to the player.

Now, there's another thing too. When you're using <VA+, <VA-, <VA*, <VA/, or <VIJ, you not only can add just a random number to your own variables, but you can also mess around with certain values inside the game as well!

For example, <VA+0501:4000 will add 4000 to the players X position.
The chart of "value hooks" is below. Have fun with the variable commands!

# Note: There is almost 0 reason to edit 90% of this, I just figured I'd add many many values while it was on my mind. Enjoy.
