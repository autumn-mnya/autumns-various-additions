The "Autumns Various Additions" dll adds various new TSC commands into the game. They are explained better here!

# TSC Commands #

- <TRM - TRansport Momentum

This TSC command is the same as <TRA, except you maintain your momentum when used. It was used in Autumn's mod "Bliss".
Arguments: 4 [<TRMwwww:zzzz:xxxx:yyyy] [map:event:x:y]

- <TRX - TRansport keep X:y
This TSC command is the same as <TRA except is preserves the players X:Y position. You need to be closer to the center of the hitbox of whatever you're interacting with to get it to properly work, as this is somewhat buggy.
Arguments: 2 [<TRMwwww:zzzz] [map:event]

- <FM2 - Focus on Me 2

This TSC command allows you to focus the camera on the player with a custom offset!
The 2nd argument is a custom "mode" field. It is explained below.
Arguments: 4 [<FM2wwww:zzzz:xxxx:yyyy] [wait:mode:x_offset:y_offset]

# 1 - X offset is a negative value     #
# 2 - Y offset is a negative value     #
# 3 - Both offsets are negative values #
