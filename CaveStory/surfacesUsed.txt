Autumns Various Additions uses unused surfaces in the game.
If an assembly hack attempts to touch an unused surface value.. Or another dll does, this will break.
I only know of my Netplay dll that uses 2 surfaces, which i am keeping in mind.

Anything listed as "UNUSED" isnt used by this dll. Anything listed as "AVA" is used by this dll.
