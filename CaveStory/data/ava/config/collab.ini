[Collab Flags]
# When <CFE is used, then a separate array of flags will be used instead of the default flags.
# When <CFD is used, this is disabled.
# When <ICF is used, they are initialized.

# Basically, these are supposed to reset upon leaving a persons mod in a collab. <FL+/<FL-/<FLJ all effect this other array instead, including normal entities.
# Because they're "temporary" per mod, we don't have to worry about other people using certain flags!

# Win-win for everyone, really.
