You're a soldier from

hundreds of robots like

finally ingested the
forbidden red flowers,<NOD

rage began to strike
back against the robots.<NOD<CLRHad the red flowers not
existed, the Mimigas might

We're up to three now...<NOD<CLR.....<NOD<CLRHave you ever seen a
frenzied Mimiga?<NOD<CLRThe cornered Mimigas hoped
that the red flowers
would grant them strength.<NOD
They ate them, and then
they fought the robots.<NOD<CLR
However...<NOD<CLRDo you know what
happened to them
afterwards?<NOD<CLR.....<NOD<CLRIt is a sad tale...<NOD
The enraged Mimigas,
likely unable to control
their own actions,<NOD
disappeared without a
trace.<NOD
If rumors are to be
trusted, they descended
to the surface,<NOD
where humans live.<NOD<CLRAn army of ferocious
Mimigas loosed upon
the earth...<NOD
If that were true...<NOD<CLRDo you understand now?<NOD
Do you understand how
dangerous the red
flowers are?<NOD<CLR.....<NOD<CLRTwo more to go...<NOD<FL+0592<END
