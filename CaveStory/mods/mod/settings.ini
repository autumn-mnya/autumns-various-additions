# This will only allow walljumping when a flag is set. Otherwise you will always be able to walljump.
Walljumps Enable on Flag = false

# This is the flag for walljumping being enabled if the above is set to true. This will be ignored if it's set to false.
Walljumps Flag = 6500

# This is the amount of horizontal speed you get from doing a walljump.
Walljumps Horizontal Speed = 1000

# Same as the above, but while submerged in water.
Underwater Walljumps Horizontal Speed = 300

# The amount of vertical momentum you get from wall jumping off of a wall. By default its the same amount of momentum as a normal jump (divided by 1.15).
Walljumps Jump Momentum = 1113

# Same as the above, but while submerged in water.
Underwater Walljumps Jump Momentum = 556

# The speed at which the player slides down a wall while holding against it, preparing to wall jump.
Wallsliding Speed = 554

# Extra Jumps #
###############

# This is the amount of momentum you get from using an extra jump. This also effects the Double Jump code below.
Extra Jump Momentum = 1280

# Same as the above, but while submerged in water.

# Double Jumping #
##################

# This will make it so you have a permanent double jump.
Double Jump Enabled = false

# This will only allow the double jump to be enabled when a flag is set. Otherwise you will always have a double jump.
Double Jump Enable on Flag = false

# This is the flag for the double jump being enabled if the above is set to true. This will be ignored if it's set to false.

# Physics + Run Button #
########################

# NOTE ABOUT THESE: NONE OF THESE ARE COMPATIBLE WITH THE <PHY HACK!

# This will make it so the physics for the player are determined from the options set below, instead of the in-game exe.
Physics in Settings.ini = true

# Requires the above setting to be set to true. Adds a run button to the game (The Shift key)
# Major note which you should include in the readme for your mod: This won't work for controller players! I highly advise using software like Joy2Key if a controller user wishes
# to play a mod with this enabled.

# Note: Running is disabled while in water.
Enable Run Button = true

# This will only allow the run button to be enabled when a flag is set. Otherwise you will always be able to run.
Enable Run Button on Flag = false

# This is the flag for the run button being enabled if the above is set to true. This will be ignored if it's set to false.
